#Test #1: Observe RF-receiver's output when the RF-transmitter is idle (not transmitting).
  * Low amplitude nose is outputted.
  * Image 1: RF-receiver's output on the spectrum when RF-transmitter is idle:

#Test #2: Input various bit-rates to the RF-transmitter and observe RF-receiver's output.
  * Best usable output is when input bit-rate is in the range: 100Hz - 4kHz
  * Image 2: RF-receiver's output on the spectrum when RF-transmitter gets an input signal of 2kHz, 50% duty cycle:

  * Image 3: RF-receiver's output on the oscilloscope (Blue channel) when RF-transmitter gets an input signal of 2kHz, 50% duty cycle (Yelloww channel):
  
#Test #2: Input 2kbps signal to the RF-transmitter, take RF-receiver's output on LPF of Fc = 3kHz and observe.
  * Image 4: RF-receiver's output (low pass filtered @Fc = 3kHz) on the spectrum when RF-transmitter gets an input signal of 2kHz, 50% duty cycle:

  * Image 5: RF-receiver's output (low pass filtered @Fc = 3kHz) on the oscilloscope (Blue channel) when RF-transmitter gets an input signal of 2kHz, 50% duty cycle (Yelloww channel):
